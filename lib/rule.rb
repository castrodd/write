   'aggravate' => 'Aggravate means "to add to" an already troublesome or vexing matter or
condition. Irritate means "to vex" or "to annoy" or "to chafe."',

   'irritate' => 'Aggravate means "to add to" an already troublesome or vexing matter or
condition. Irritate means "to vex" or "to annoy" or "to chafe."',

   'allright' => 'Idiomatic in familiar speech as a detached phrase in the sense "Agreed," or "Go
ahead," or "O.K." Properly written as two words — all right.',

   'allude' => 'Do not confuse with elude. You allude to a book; you elude a pursuer. Note, too,
that allude is not synonymous with refer. An allusion is an indirect mention, a reference is
a specific one.',

   'allusion' => 'Easily confused with illusion. The first means "an indirect reference"; the second
      means "an unreal image" or "a false impression".',

   'alternate' => 'The words are not always interchangeable as nouns or adjectives.
Alternate means every other one in a series; alternative, one of two possibilities. As the
other one of a series of two, an alternate may stand for "a substitute," but an alternative,
although used in a similar sense, connotes a matter of choice that is never present with
alternate.',

although used in a similar sense, connotes a matter of choice that is never present with

   'among' => 'When more than two things or persons are involved, among is usually
called for: "The money was divided among the four players." When, however, more than
two are involved but each is considered individually, between is preferred: "an agreement
between the six heirs."',

    'between' => 'When more than two things or persons are involved, among is usually
called for: "The money was divided among the four players." When, however, more than
two are involved but each is considered individually, between is preferred: "an agreement
between the six heirs."',

  'anticipate' => 'Use expect in the sense of simple expectation.',

  'anybody' => 'In the sense of "any person," not to be written as two words. Any body means
"any corpse," or "any human form," or "any group." The rule holds equally for everybody,
nobody, and somebody.',

  'anyone' => 'In the sense of "anybody," written as one word. Any one means "any single
person" or "any single thing."',

  'as good or better than' => 'Expressions of this type should be corrected by rearranging the
sentences.',

  'as to whether' => 'Whether is sufficient.',

  'as yet' => 'Yet nearly always is as good, if not better. The chief exception is at the beginning of a sentence, where yet means something
different.',

  'being' => 'Not appropriate after "regard as".',

  'but' => 'Unnecessary after doubt and help.',

  'can' => 'Means "am (is, are) able." Not to be used as a substitute for may.',

  'care less' => 'The dismissive "I couldn\'t care less" is often used with the shortened "not"
mistakenly (and mysteriously) omitted: "I could care less." The error destroys the meaning
of the sentence and is careless indeed.',

  'case' => 'Often unnecessary. BAD: "In many cases, the rooms lacked air
conditioning." BETTER: "Many of the rooms lacked air conditioning."',

  'certainly' => 'Used indiscriminately by some speakers, much as others use very, in an attempt
to intensify any and every statement. A mannerism of this kind, bad in speech, is even
worse in writing.',

  'character' => 'Often simply redundant, used from a mere habit of wordiness. BAD: "acts of a hostile character" BETTER: "hostile acts"',

  'claim' => 'Means "lay claim to." Not to be used as a substitute for declare, maintain,
or charge.',

  'clever' => 'Note that the word means one thing when applied to people, another when applied
to horses. A clever horse is a good-natured one, not an ingenious one.',

  'compare' => 'To compare to is to point out or imply resemblances between objects regarded
as essentially of a different order; to compare with is mainly to point out differences
between objects regarded as essentially of the same order. Thus, life has been compared
to a pilgrimage, to a drama, to a battle; Congress may be compared with the British
Parliament. Paris has been compared to ancient Athens; it may be compared with modern
London.',

  'comprise' => 'Literally, "embrace": A zoo comprises mammals, reptiles, and birds (because it
"embraces," or "includes," them). But animals do not comprise ("embrace") a zoo — they
constitute a zoo.',

  'consider as' => 'Not followed by as when it means "believe to be." When considered means "examined" or "discussed," it is followed by as.',

  'contact' => 'As a transitive verb, the word is vague and self-important. Do not contact people;
get in touch with them, look them up, phone them, find them, or meet them.',

  'cope' => 'An intransitive verb used with with. In formal writing, one doesn\'t "cope," one "copes
with" something or somebody.',

  'currently' => 'In the sense of now with a verb in the present tense, currently is usually
redundant; emphasis is better achieved through a more precise reference to time.',

  'data' => 'Like strata, phenomena, and media, data is a plural and is best used with a plural
verb. The word, however, is slowly gaining acceptance as a singular.',

  'different than' => 'Here logic supports established usage: one thing differs from another,
hence, different from. Or, other than, unlike.',

  'disinterested' => 'Means "impartial." Do not confuse it with uninterested, which means "not
interested in.',

  'divided into' => 'Not to be misused for composed of. The line is sometimes difficult to draw;
doubtless plays are divided into acts, but poems are composed of stanzas. An apple,
halved, is divided into sections, but an apple is composed of seeds, flesh, and skin.',

  'due to' => 'Loosely used for through, because of, or owing to, in adverbial phrases. In correct use, synonymous with attributable to: "The accident was due to bad weather";
"losses due to preventable fires."',

  'each and every one' => 'Pitchman\'s jargon. Avoid, except in dialogue.',

  'effect' => ' As a noun, means "result"; as a verb, means "to bring about," "to accomplish" (not
to be confused with affect, which means "to influence"). As a noun, often loosely used in perfunctory writing about fashions, music, painting, and
other arts: "a Southwestern effect"; "effects in pale green"; "very delicate effects"; "subtle
effects"; "a charming effect was produced." The writer who has a definite meaning to
express will not take refuge in such vagueness.',

  'enormity' => 'Use only in the sense of "monstrous wickedness." Misleading, if not wrong,
when used to express bigness.',

  'enthuse' => 'An annoying verb growing out of the noun enthusiasm. Not recommended.',

  'etc' => 'Literally, "and other things"; sometimes loosely used to mean "and other persons."
The phrase is equivalent to and the rest, and so forth, and hence is not to be used if one of
these would be insufficient — that is, if the reader would be left in doubt as to any
important particulars. Least open to objection when it represents the last terms of a list
already given almost in full, or immaterial words at the end of a quotation.
At the end of a list introduced by such as, for example, or any similar expression, etc. is
incorrect. In formal writing, etc. is a misfit. An item important enough to call for etc. is
probably important enough to be named.',

  'fact' => 'Use this word only of matters capable of direct verification, not of matters of
judgment. That a particular event happened on a given date and that lead melts at a
certain temperature are facts. But such conclusions as that Napoleon was the greatest of
modern generals or that the climate of California is delightful, however defensible they may
be, are not properly called facts.',

  'facility' => 'Why must jails, hospitals, and schools suddenly become "facilities"?',

  'factor' => 'A hackneyed word; the expressions of which it is a part can usually be replaced by
something more direct and idiomatic.',

  'farther' => 'The two words are commonly interchanged, but there is a distinction
worth observing: farther serves best as a distance word, further as a time or quantity word.
You chase a ball farther than the other fellow; you pursue a subject further.',

  'feature' => 'Another hackneyed word; like factor, it usually adds nothing to the sentence in
which it occurs. As a verb, in the sense of "offer as a special attraction," it is to be avoided.',

  'finalize' => ' A pompous, ambiguous verb.',

  'fix' => 'Colloquial in America for arrange, prepare, mend. The usage is well established. But
bear in mind that this verb is from figere: "to make firm," "to place definitely." These are the
preferred meanings of the word.',

  'flammable' => 'An oddity, chiefly useful in saving lives. The common word meaning
"combustible" is inflammable. But some people are thrown off by the in- and think
inflammable means "not combustible." For this reason, trucks carrying gasoline or
explosives are now marked FLAMMABLE. Unless you are operating such a truck and hence
are concerned with the safety of children and illiterates, use inflammable.',

  'folk' => 'A collective noun, equivalent to people. Use the singular form only. Folks, in the
sense of "parents," "family," "those present," is colloquial and too folksy for formal writing.',

  'fortuitous' => 'Limited to what happens by chance. Not to be used for fortunate or lucky.',

  'get' => 'The colloquial "have got" for "have" should not be used in writing. The preferable form of
the participle is got, not gotten.',

  'gratuitous' => 'Means "unearned," or "unwarranted."',

  'he is a man who' => 'A common type of redundant expression. BAD: "He is a man who is very ambitious." BETTER: "He is very ambitious."',

  'hopefully' => 'This once-useful adverb meaning "with hope" has been distorted and is now
widely used to mean "I hope" or "it is to be hoped." Such use is not merely wrong, it is silly.
To say, "Hopefully I\'ll leave on the noon plane" is to talk nonsense. Do you mean you\'ll
leave on the noon plane in a hopeful frame of mind? Or do you mean you hope you\'ll leave
on the noon plane? Whichever you mean, you haven\'t said it clearly. Although the word in
its new, free-floating capacity may be pleasurable and even useful to many, it offends the
ear of many others, who do not like to see words dulled or eroded, particularly when the
erosion leads to ambiguity, softness, or nonsense.',

  'however' => 'Avoid starting a sentence with however when the meaning is "nevertheless."
The word usually serves better when not in first position. When however comes first, it means "in whatever way" or "to whatever extent."',

  'imply' => ' Not interchangeable. Something implied is something suggested or indicated,
though not expressed. Something inferred is something deduced from evidence at hand. COMPARE: "Farming implies early rising."
"Since she was a farmer, we inferred that she got up early."',

  'infer' => ' Not interchangeable. Something implied is something suggested or indicated,
though not expressed. Something inferred is something deduced from evidence at hand. COMPARE: "Farming implies early rising."
"Since she was a farmer, we inferred that she got up early."',

  'importantly' => 'Avoid by rephrasing. BAD: "More importantly, he paid for the damages." BETTER: "What\'s more, he paid for the damages."',

  'in regard to' => 'Often wrongly written in regards to. But as regards is correct, and means the
same thing.',

  'in the last analysis' => 'A bankrupt expression.',

  'inside of' => 'The of following inside is correct in the adverbial meaning "in less than."
In other meanings, of is unnecessary. EXAMPLE: "Inside of five minutes I\'ll be inside the bank."',

  'insightful' => 'The word is a suspicious overstatement for "perceptive." If it is to be used at all,
it should be used for instances of remarkably penetrating vision. Usually, it crops up
merely to inflate the commonplace.',

  'in terms of' => 'A piece of padding usually best omitted.',

  'interesting' => 'An unconvincing word; avoid it as a means of introduction. Instead of
announcing that what you are about to tell is interesting, make it so.',

  'irregardless' => 'Should be regardless. The error results from failure to see the negative in -
less and from a desire to get it in as a prefix, suggested by such words as irregular,
irresponsible, and, perhaps especially, irrespective.',


  'kind of' => 'Except in familiar style, not to be used as a substitute for rather or something like.
Restrict it to its literal sense: "Amber is a kind of fossil resin"; "I dislike that kind of
publicity." The same holds true for sort of.',

  'lay' => 'A transitive verb. Except in slang ("Let it lay"), do not misuse it for the intransitive verb
lie. The hen, or the play, lays an egg; the llama lies down. The playwright went home and
lay down.',

  'leave' => 'Not to be misused for let. BAD: "Leave it stand the way it is." BETTER: "Let it stand the way it is."',

  'less' => 'Should not be misused for fewer. Less refers to quantity, fewer to number. "His troubles are less than mine" means "His
troubles are not so great as mine." "His troubles are fewer than mine" means "His troubles
are not so numerous as mine."',

  'like' => 'Not to be used for the conjunction as. Like governs nouns and pronouns; before
phrases and clauses the equivalent word is as. BAD: "We spent the evening like in the old days." BETTER: "We spent the evening as in the old days."',

  'line' => 'Line in the sense of "course of procedure, conduct, thought" is
allowable but has been so overworked, particularly in the phrase along these lines, that a
writer who aims at freshness or originality had better discard it entirely.',

  'literal' => ' Often incorrectly used in support of exaggeration or violent metaphor.',

  'literally' => ' Often incorrectly used in support of exaggeration or violent metaphor.',

  'loan' => 'A noun. As a verb, prefer lend. DO: "Lend me your ears." DON\'T: "the loan of your ears."',

  'meaningful' => 'A bankrupt adjective. Choose another, or rephrase.',

  'memento' => 'Often incorrectly written momento.',

  'most' => ' Not to be used for almost in formal composition.',

  'nature' => 'Often simply redundant, used like character. Nature should be avoided in such vague expressions as "a lover of nature," "poems about
nature." Unless more specific statements follow, the reader cannot tell whether the poems have to do with natural scenery, rural life, the sunset, the untracked wilderness, or the
habits of squirrels.',

  'nauseous' => 'Naseous means "sickening to contemplate"; nauseated means
"sick at the stomach." Do not, therefore, say, "I feel nauseous," unless you are sure you
have that effect on others.',

  'nice' => 'A shaggy, all-purpose word, to be used sparingly in formal composition. "I had a nice
time." "It was nice weather." "She was so nice to her mother." The meanings are indistinct.
Nice is most useful in the sense of "precise" or "delicate": "a nice distinction."',

  'nor' => 'Often used wrongly for or after negative expressions.',

  'offputting' => 'Newfound adjectives, to be avoided because they are inexact and
      clumsy. Ongoing is a mix of "continuing" and "active" and is usually superfluous.Offputting might mean "objectionable," "disconcerting," "distasteful."',

  'ongoing' => 'Newfound adjectives, to be avoided because they are inexact and
      clumsy. Ongoing is a mix of "continuing" and "active" and is usually superfluous.Offputting might mean "objectionable," "disconcerting," "distasteful."',

  'one of the most' => 'Avoid this feeble formula. "One of the most exciting developments of
      modern science is ..."; "Switzerland is one of the most beautiful countries of Europe."
      There is nothing wrong with the grammar; the formula is simply threadbare.',

  'partially' => 'Not always interchangeable with partly. Best used in the sense of "to a certain
      degree," when speaking of a condition or state: "I\'m partially resigned to it."Partly carries
      the idea of a part as distinct from the whole — usually a physical object.',

  'people' => 'The people is a political term, not to be confused with the public. From the
      people comes political support or opposition; from the public comes artistic appreciation or
      commercial patronage. The word people is best not used with words of number, in place of persons. If of "six
      people" five went away, how many people would be left? Answer: one people.',

  'personalize' => 'A pretentious word, often carrying bad advice. Do not personalize your prose;
      simply make it good and keep it clean.',

  'possess' => 'Often used because to the writer it sounds more impressive than have or own.
      Such usage is not incorrect but is to be guarded against.',

  'presently' => 'Has two meanings: "in a short while" and "currently." Because of this ambiguity
      it is best restricted to the first meaning: "She\'ll be here presently" ("soon," or "in a short
      time").',

  'prestigious' => 'Often an adjective of last resort. It\'s in the dictionary, but that doesn\'t mean
      you have to use it.',

  'regretful' => 'Sometimes carelessly used for regrettable: "The mixup was due to a regretful
      breakdown in communications."',

  'relate' => 'Not to be used intransitively to suggest rapport. BAD: "I relate well to Janet." BETTER: "Janet and I have a lot in common."',

  'respective' => 'These words may usually be omitted with advantage. BAD: "Works of fiction are listed under the names
      of their respective authors." BETTER: "Works of fiction are listed under the names of their authors."',

  'secondly' => 'Unless you are prepared to begin with firstly and defend it (which will
      be difficult), do not prettify numbers with -ly. Modern usage prefers second, third, and so on.',

  'state' => 'Not to be used as a mere substitute for say, remark. Restrict it to the sense of
        "express fully or clearly": "He refused to state his objections."',

  'student body' => 'Nine times out of ten a needless and awkward expression, meaning no
        more than the simple word students. BAD: "popular with the student body" BETTER: "liked by the students"',

  'than' => 'Any sentence with than (to express comparison) should be examined to make sure no essential words are missing.',

  'thanking you in advance' => 'This sounds as if the writer meant, "It will not be worth my while to write to you again."',

  'that' => 'That is the defining, or restrictive, pronoun, which the nondefining, or nonrestrictive. The use of which for that is common in written and spoken language ("Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass."). Occasionally which seems preferable to that, as in the sentence from the Bible. But it would be a convenience to all if these two pronouns were used with precision. Careful writers, watchful for small conveniences, go which-hunting, remove the defining whiches, and by so doing improve their work.',

  'the foreseeable future' => 'A cliche, and a fuzzy one. How much of the future is foreseeable? Ten minutes? Ten years? Any of it? By whom is it foreseeable? Seers? Experts? Everybody?',

  'the truth is' => 'A bad beginning for a sentence. If you feel you are possessed of the truth, or of the fact, simply state it. Do not give it advance billing.',

  'they' => 'Do not use they when the antecedent is a distributive expression such as each, each one, everybody, every one, many a man. Use the singular pronoun. BAD: "The writer must address his readers\' concerns." BETTER: "Writers must address their readers\' concerns."',

  'this' => 'The pronoun this, referring to the complete sense of a preceding sentence or clause, can\'t always carry the load and so may produce an imprecise statement.',

  'thrust' => 'This showy noun, suggestive of power, hinting of sex, is the darling of executives, politicos, and speech-writers. Use it sparingly. Save it for specific application.',

  'tortuous' => 'A winding road is tortuous, a painful ordeal is torturous. Both words carry the idea of "twist," the twist having been a form of torture.',

  'transpire' => 'Not to be used in the sense of "happen," "come to pass." Many writers so use it (usually when groping toward imagined elegance), but their usage finds little support in the Latin "breathe across or through." It is correct, however, in the sense of "become known." "Eventually, the grim account of his villainy transpired" (literally, "leaked through or out").',

  'try' => 'Takes the infinitive: "try to mend it," not "try and mend it." Students of the language will argue that try and has won through and become idiom. Indeed it has, and it is relaxed and acceptable. But try to is precise, and when you are writing formal prose, try and write try to.',

  'type' => 'Not a synonym for kind of. The examples below are common vulgarisms. BAD: "that type employee" BETTER: "that kind of employee"',

  'unique' => 'Means "without like or equal." Hence, there can be no degrees of uniqueness. BAD: "It was the most unique coffee maker on the market." BETTER: "It was a unique coffee maker."',

  'utilize' => 'Prefer use. BAD: "I utilized the facilities." BETTER: "I used the toilet."',

  'verbal' => 'Sometimes means "word for word" and in this sense may refer to something
expressed in writing. Oral (from Latin os, "mouth") limits the meaning to what is transmitted
by speech. Oral agreement is more precise than verbal agreement.',

  'very' => 'Use this word sparingly. Where emphasis is necessary, use words strong in
themselves.',

  'while' => 'Avoid the indiscriminate use of this word for and, but, and although. Many writers
use it frequently as a substitute for and or but, either from a mere desire to vary the
connective or from doubt about which of the two connectives is more appropriate. In this
use it is best replaced by a semicolon.',

  'worth while' => 'Overworked as a term of vague approval and (with not) of disapproval.
Strictly applicable only to actions: "Is it worth while to telegraph?" The adjective worthwhile (one word) is acceptable but emaciated. Use a stronger word.',
